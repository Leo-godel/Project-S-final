# Project-S-final
We create a fictional binary star solar system which has two suns, one Earth and
one moon and simulate the orbital motion of these celestial bodies. Based on the
observation data from a local position on Earth, we use machine learning techniques
and successfully learn the time evolution curve of the moon phase and the altitude
and azimuth of the other three celestial bodies including the two suns and the
moon. Furthermore, we demonstrate the underlying physics of these time evolution
curves which can help us better understand the physical principles dominating the
astronomical phenomena. Below is the link to our project directory
